Certainly! Here are 25 of the most commonly asked array interview questions:

1. **Find the missing number in an array of size n containing numbers from 1 to n+1.**
2. **Find the duplicate number in an array containing n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n.**
3. **Merge two sorted arrays.**
4. **Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's Algorithm).**
5. **Rotate an array by k positions.**
6. **Rearrange an array such that positive and negative numbers alternate, maintaining their relative order.**
7. **Find the intersection of two arrays.**
8. **Find the union of two arrays.**
9. **Find the first repeating element in an array.**
10. **Find the first non-repeating element in an array.**
11. **Find the majority element (element that appears more than n/2 times).**
12. **Find the median of two sorted arrays.**
13. **Find the kth largest element in an array.**
14. **Find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than a given value.**
