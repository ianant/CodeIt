:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Two Pointers Probelm Solving Techniques:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
How to identify:
Some common problems with the two-pointer method:

1-Squaring a sorted array
2-Triplets that sum to zero
3-Comparing strings that contain backspaces




Pair with Target Sum:

Problem: Given a sorted array of integers and a target sum, find a pair of numbers that sum up to the target.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6
Output: [1, 3] (The indices of the numbers adding up to 6 are 1 and 3)
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:

Problem: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: arr = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5 (The array becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...])
Dutch National Flag Problem:

Problem: Given an array containing 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in-place without using extra space.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: arr = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Triplet Sum to Zero:

Problem: Given an array of unsorted numbers, find all unique triplets in it that add up to zero.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: arr = [-3, 0, 1, 2, -1, 1, -2]
Output: [[-3, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 2], [-2, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1]]
Subarray Product Less Than K:

Problem: Given an array of positive integers and a positive number k, find the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than k.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: arr = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Container With Most Water:

Problem: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
4Sum:



Problem: Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], target = 0
Output: [[-1,  0, 0, 1], [-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2,  0, 0, 2]]
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:

Problem: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 (The longest substring is "abc", with the length of 3)
These problems cover a variety of scenarios where the two-pointer technique is effective, ranging from finding sums to handling duplicates and finding the optimal solutions.
